-seriously do some cleanup, factor out RayPlatform into its own lib probably, why do I have like 3 different rectangle types

-Performance is an issue.
	Try:
		moving away from RTTI-powered polymorphism, data orientation is GOOD
		maybe doing some optimizations in A* implementation
		switch to an imperative model?

-possibly combine view and subscriptions into a single "mediator"

-Make only some entities block pathfinding, so creatures can pathfind through items etc
